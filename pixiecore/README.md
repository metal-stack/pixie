# Pixiecore

Pixiecore is an all-in-one tool to manage network booting of
machines. It can be used either as a simple tool for ad-hoc network
boots, or as a building block of machine management infrastructure.

## Why?

Booting a Linux system over the network is quite tedious. You have to
set up a TFTP server, reconfigure your DHCP server to recognize PXE
clients, and send them the right set of magical options to get them to
boot, often fighting rubbish PXE ROM implementations.

Pixiecore aims to simplify this process, by packing the whole process
into a single binary that can cooperate with your network's existing
DHCP server. You don't need to reconfigure anything else in the
network.

If you're curious about the whole process that Pixiecore manages, you
can read the details in [README.booting](README.booting.md).

## Installation

Install Pixiecore via `go get`:

```shell
go get go.universe.tf/netboot/cmd/pixiecore
```

## Using Pixiecore in static mode ("I just want to boot a machine")

Run the pixiecore binary, passing it a kernel and initrd, and
optionally some extra kernel commandline arguments. For example,
here's how you make all machines in your network netboot into the
alpha release of CoreOS, with automatic login:

```shell
sudo pixiecore boot \
  https://alpha.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/coreos_production_pxe.vmlinuz \
  https://alpha.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/coreos_production_pxe_image.cpio.gz \
  --cmdline='coreos.autologin'
```

That's it! Any machine that tries to boot from the network will now
boot into CoreOS.

That's a bit slow to boot, because Pixiecore is refetching the images
from core-os.net each time a machine tries to boot. We can also
download the files and use those:

```shell
wget https://alpha.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/coreos_production_pxe.vmlinuz \
wget https://alpha.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/coreos_production_pxe_image.cpio.gz \
sudo pixiecore boot \
  coreos_production_pxe.vmlinuz \
  coreos_production_pxe_image.cpio.gz
  --cmdline='coreos.autologin'
```

Sometimes, you want to give extra files to the booting OS. For
example, CoreOS lets you pass a Cloud Init file via the
`cloud-config-url` kernel commandline parameter. That's fine if you
have a URL, but what if you have a local file?

For this, Pixiecore lets you specify that you want an additional file
served over HTTP to the booting OS, via a template function. Let's
grab a [cloud-config.yml](https://goo.gl/7HzZf2) that sets the
hostname to `pixiecore-test`, and serve it:

```shell
wget -O my-cloud-config.yml https://goo.gl/7HzZf2
sudo pixiecore boot \
  coreos_production_pxe.vmlinuz \
  coreos_production_pxe_image.cpio.gz
  --cmdline='coreos.autologin cloud-config-url={{ ID "./my-cloud-config.yml" }}'
```

Pixiecore will transform the template invocation into a URL that, when
fetched, serves `my-cloud-config.yml`. Similarly to the kernel and
initrd arguments, you can also pass a URL to the `ID` template
function.

## Pixiecore in API mode

Think of Pixiecore in API mode as a "PXE to HTTP" translator. Whenever
Pixiecore sees a machine trying to netboot, it will ask a remote HTTP
API (which you implement) what to do. The API server can tell
Pixiecore to ignore the machine, or tell it to boot into a given
kernel/initrd/commandline.

Effectively, Pixiecore in API mode lets you pretend that your machines
speak a simple JSON protocol when trying to netboot. This makes it
_far_ easier to play with netbooting in your own software.

To start Pixiecore in API mode, pass it the URL of your API endpoint:

```shell
sudo pixiecore api https://foo.example/pixiecore
```

The endpoint you provide must implement the Pixiecore boot API, as
described in the [API spec](README.api.md).

You can find a sample API server implementation in the `example`
subdirectory. The code is not production-grade, but gives a short
illustration of how the protocol works by reimplementing a subset of
Pixiecore's static mode as an API server.

## Running in Docker

Pixiecore is available as a Docker image called
`danderson/pixiecore`. It's an automatic Docker Hub build that tracks
the repository.

Because Pixiecore needs to listen for DHCP traffic, it has to run with
the host network stack.

```shell
sudo docker run -v .:/image --net=host danderson/pixiecore boot /image/coreos_production_pxe.vmlinuz /image/coreos_production_pxe_image.cpio.gz
```
